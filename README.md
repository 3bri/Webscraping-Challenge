# Webscraping-Challenge
Challenge 11 â€“ webscraping

Brian Guenther

Used Splinter and Beautiful Soup to access and analyze two websites in conjunction with the Chrome web browser.  Desired elements of the webpage were identified and that the information was extracted through webscraping into Python and Pandas for the Creation, Reading, Updating, and Deletion of information.  In part 1, I extracted a summary of linked articles relating to news about Mars.  In part 2, data relating to weather on Mars was extracted from a table and analyzed along with the generation of plots relating to low temperatures and atmospheric pressure

For the most part, I was able to accomplish most of this based on past assignments and lecture examples.  I do want to especially draw attention to my tutor who aided my understanding of objects and actionable function for reading in the information for part 1.

Regarding part 2,  I was struggling with correctly reading in the  different format of the table (compared to class example) on the weather page until I found the following link on stackoverflow.

I also confirmed the process for converting an object to datetime with this link.

Otherwise, I completed the assignment based on past work or experimenting with my initial coding attempt.
